# # Student Database  Script

This script is designed to automatically fill in a PostgreSQL database  with data from two files: courses.csv and students.csv. 

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL database server installed
- Access privileges to create and modify tables in the "students" database
- CSV files containing the necessary data:
  - `courses.csv`
  - `students.csv`

## Notes

- If you get any errors while executing the script,  view the error messages displayed and verify that your database credentials and file paths are correctly configured.

- Make sure to backup any existing data in the students db before running this script, cos it will truncate the tables before inserting new data.
